summary: Retinal fundus cameras suffer from dust particles attaching to the sensor and lens, which manifest as small artifacts on the images. We propose a new strategy for the detection and removal of dust particle artifacts in retinal images. We consider as input two or more color fundus images acquired within the same session, in which we assume the artifacts remain in the same position. Our method consists in detecting candidate artifacts via normalized cross correlation with an artifact template, performing segmentation via region growing, and comparing the segmentations in all images. This guarantees that all detections are consistent for all images. The removal stage consists in an inpainting procedure so that the new region does not stand out from the neighboring regions. Encouraging experimental results show the localization of artifacts is effective and the artifacts are successfully removed, while not introducing new artifacts in the color retinal images.
