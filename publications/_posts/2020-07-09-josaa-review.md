summary: This paper reviews recent developments of non-contact 3D three-dimensional (3D) surface metrology using an active structured optical probe. We primarily focus on those active non-contact 3D surface mea- surement techniques that could be applicable to the manufacturing industry. We discuss principles of each technology, and its advantageous characteristics as well as limitations. Towards the end, we will discuss our perspectives on the current technological challenges in designing and implementing these methods in practical applications.
