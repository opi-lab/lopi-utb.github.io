summary: We propose a calibration method for increasing the overall accuracy of a large-scale structured light system by leveraging the conventional stereo calibration approach with the pinhole model. Our approach is a multi-stage procedure in which the intrinsic parameters are calibrated at a near distance, while the extrinsic parameters are calibrated with a low-cost large-format calibration target placed at a far distance. Finally, we compute pixel-wise error maps and use a low-order polynomial function to map the corrected metric coordinates to the absolute phase to obtain fast and accurate 3D reconstruction. We experimentally demonstrated that our proposed method achieves high accuracy for a large volume&#58; sub-millimeter within 1200(H) ⨉ 800 (V) ⨉ 1000(D) mm^3.
