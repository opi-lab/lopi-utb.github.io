summary: The changes produced in the quality of retinal images of patients after intraocular lens implantation surgery is considered. Several factors concerning the optical system of the eye, the ocular media, and the implanted intraocular lens, may have an influence on the quality of the image acquired with a non-mydriatic retinal camera. We illustrate our study with several cases taken from the clinical practice. A pair of eye fundus images represents each case: one taken before and the other after surgery. A quality measure based on a calculation of image anisotropy is applied to each image.
