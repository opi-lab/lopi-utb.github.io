summary: In this work, we introduce a Structure from Motion (SfM) pipeline using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for generating DEMs for perform- ing topographic reconstructions and assessing the microtopography of a terrain. SfM is a computer vision technique that consists in estimating the 3D coordinates of many points in a scene using two or more 2D images acquired from different positions. By identifying common points in the images both the camera position (motion) and the 3D locations of the points (structure) are obtained. The output from an SfM stage is a sparse point cloud in a local XYZ coordinate system. We edit the obtained point in MeshLab to remove unwanted points, such as those from vehicles, roofs, and vegetation. We scale the XYZ point clouds us- ing Ground Control Points (GCP) and GPS information. This process enables georeferenced metric measurements. For the experimental verification, we reconstructed a terrain suitable for subsequent analysis using GIS software. Encouraging results show that our approach is highly cost-effective, providing a means for generating high-quality, low-cost DEMs.
