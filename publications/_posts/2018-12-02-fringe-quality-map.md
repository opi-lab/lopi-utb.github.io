summary: The phase retrieval process is mainly affected by local shadows, irregular surface brightness and fringe discontinuities. In order to overcome these problems, pre-processing strategies are carried out such as binary masks, interpolation techniques and filtering to remove noise. Similarly, many unwrapping algorithms have been developed to handle phase unwrapping errors in two-dimensional regions affected by problems that lead to failures. The presence of error-prone areas, in many cases, can be controlled from the acquisition stage avoiding the use of fringe preprocessing strategies and sophisticated phase unwrapping algorithms, which in many cases represent high computational costs and long execution times. To help overcome these problems, we propose an acquisition strategy based on a fringe quality map in order to obtain the most accurate 3D reconstruction. The software was fully implemented in LabVIEW, and we provide the software as supplementary material. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves the phase unwrapping stage and avoids the use of pre-processing strategies, which lead to inaccurate 3D reconstruction.
