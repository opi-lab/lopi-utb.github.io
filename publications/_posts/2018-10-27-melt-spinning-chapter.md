summary: Chill block melt spinning is used in industrial processes for the production of metallic glasses. It is a rapid solidification process whereby a liquid metal is ejected at high pressure and temperature via a nozzle onto a rotating wheel solidifying in the form of a ribbon. In this work, starting from an alloy with the composition of Fe78Si9B13 (% at.) reproduces the melt spinning technique to get the amorphous magnetic material. A CFD3D model based on the finite volume method (FVM) is proposed. For this purpose, the OpenFoam® open source code is used. In the ribbon production stage, it has been observed that the turbulence involved in the first reported transient lasts a few milliseconds, enough time to study the process with high-speed cameras. We measure the ejection speed by using optical flow on the melt contour. This enables us to check defects in the ribbons, which are predicted with the computational model, such as the case of cracks caused by irregularities in the first formation of the solid layer. The temperature measurement method relies on the fact that the digital camera is sensitive to electromagnetic radiation between 400 and 1000 nm in wavelength and the fact that the image gray level, which is proportional to the temperature T, provided the background illumination level is negligible.
