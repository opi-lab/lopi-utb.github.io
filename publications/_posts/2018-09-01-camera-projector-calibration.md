summary: The calibration methods most used in fringe projection profilometry are based on models of least squares adjustment and stereo vision techniques. However, the geometric distortions of the projector and camera lenses introduce imprecision in certain regions of the 3D reconstruction. In this paper, we perform a comparative study between the second order polynomial adjustment method and the stereo calibration method applying lens distortion compensation. The experimental results show that in the stereo calibration the incidence of the distortions in the 3D reconstruction is significant. In contrast, in the proposed polynomial calibration, reconstruction errors are associated with the calibrated volume, typically low within the calibration volume..
