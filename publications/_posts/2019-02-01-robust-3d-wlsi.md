summary: White Light Scanning Interference (WLSI) microscopes provide an accurate surface topography of engi- neered surfaces. However, the measurement accuracy is substantially reduced in surfaces with low re- flectivity regions or high roughness, like a surface affected by corrosion. An alternative technique called Shape from Focus (SFF) takes advantage of the surface texture to recover the 3D surface by using a focus metric through a vertical scan. In this work, we propose a technique called SFF-WLSI, which consists in recovering the 3D surface of an object by applying the Tennegrad Variance (TENV) focus metric to WLSI images. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed technique yield accurate measurements un- der different surface roughness and surface reflectivity outperforming the conventional WLSI and the SFF techniques. We validated the simulation results on two real objects with a Mirau-type microscope. The first, a flat lapping specimen with Ra = 0.05 μm for which we measured an average value of Ra = 0.055 μm and standard deviation σ = 0.008 μm. The second, a metallic sphere with corrosion which we recon- structed with WLSI versus the proposed SFF-WLSI technique producing a better 3D reconstruction with less undefined depth values.
