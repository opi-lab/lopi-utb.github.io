<!--I'm an Assistant Member at the [Fred Hutch](http://www.fredhutch.org/) in the [Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division](https://www.fhcrc.org/en/labs/vaccine-and-infectious-disease.html) and the [Computational Biology Program](http://labs.fhcrc.org/compbio/). I'm also an Affiliate Assistant Professor in the [Department of Epidemiology](http://depts.washington.edu/epidem/welcome) at the [University of Washington School of Public Health](http://sph.washington.edu/). I study the dynamics of virus populations.  How do strains spread through the world?  How do strains evolve in response to immune pressure?  And ultimately, what makes a strain successful?-->

<!--I received my bachelor's degree from the University of Chicago and my PhD from Harvard University, advised by [Dan Hartl](http://www.oeb.harvard.edu/faculty/hartl/lab/DanielHartl.html).  Following my PhD I worked for Wolfram Research on [Wolfram|Alpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com/), worked on infectious disease dynamics at the University of Michigan with [Mercedes Pascual](http://www.lsa.umich.edu/eeb/directory/faculty/pascual/) and worked on viral phylogenetics with [Andrew Rambaut](http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/people/arambaut/) at the University of Edinburgh.-->
